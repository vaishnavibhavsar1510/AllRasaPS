# AllRasaPS
**(SIH Winner 2023)** Comprehensive Taste Classification: Utilizing SVM and kNN algorithms facilitates comprehensive taste classification, covering a wide range of taste profiles. Classification into Primary and secondary Rasa of a given crude herb, with its accuracy percent.


Hereby follow simple steps to find the Rasas based on the input values of the crude herb:
(Also the dataPS.csv is the database created from scratch and used for this classificatn)

**Step 1**:Open the terminal and run the following command
           Commmand:** streamlit run AppPS.py**


**Step 2**: Input the values of the given compounds in the Ayurvedic herb after detecting from the sensor and algorithm will work for its classification into Rasa(taste type)(there are major 5 types of Rasa).

Rasas Type: 1. Madhura (Sweet)
            2. Amla (Sour)
            3. Lavana (Salty)
            4. Katu (Pungent)
            5. Tikta (Bitter)
            
**Step 3**: Click On Predict to get the output as a graph .

Thus here accuracy of predicted model is also defined.
 The Ayurvedic pharmacological practice relies on the identification of 
Rasa (taste) as a fundamental parameter for drug recognition. This taste perception is crucial 
for predicting the pharmaco-therapeutic effects of Ayurvedic drugs, forming the basis for 
principles such as guṇa (quality), vīrya (potency), and vipāka (effect of biotransformation). The 
identification of Rasa is integral to Ayurvedic drug development and materia medica 
standardization.
